## Fortnite Discord RPC

A simple program that allows you to have Fortnite RPC regardless of the platform on which you play. Made with pypresence and fortnitepy. 
Its needed a PC (obviously with discord installed) and an unused epic account (used to log in and monitore your status)

### Setup

First install the required libraries with `install.bat` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run the script run `start.bat` or `python3 main.py`. On the first start you will see an text saying _'Please enter a valid authorization code'_. Enter to [this link](https://www.epicgames.com/id/logout?redirectUrl=https%3A//www.epicgames.com/id/login%3FredirectUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.epicgames.com%252Fid%252Fapi%252Fredirect%253FclientId%253D3446cd72694c4a4485d81b77adbb2141%2526responseType%253Dcode) and log in to an epic account (dont use your main account, the account should not be used. You can create an account exclusively for this)

Once you have entered the page you will see text, you will have to look for exactly this code (image) and paste it into the console. (Do not use key combinations like CTRL+C or CTRL+V as they can cancel the process)

When you have pasted the code the account you have chosen will log in as a bot. Now the presence will start when you are connected. To deactivate it just close the program
